# Grassmanian Lecture Notes
These are the notes for a lecture I gave to the reading group on the Grassmanian at University of Washington, Seattle on July 8, 2019.

The primary focus of the first half is to motivate and prove the realization of the Grassmanian as the quotient of GL_n in order to prove some nice properties vis a vis its smooth manifold theory.

The second half consists of some notes from a paper by Taft and Towber on constructing a quantum analog of Gr(n,k) which aligns more closely with my current research direction.
