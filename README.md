# Grassmanian Lecture Notes
These are the notes for a lecture I gave to the reading group on the Grassmanian at University of Washington, Seattle on July 8, 2019.

The primary focus is to motivate and prove the realization of the Grassmanian as the quotient of GL_n in order to prove some nice properties vis a vis smooth manifold theory.
